Deep Learning Classification Project | Adult Income Dataset (UCI)
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Deep Learning pipeline to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K per year using the UCI Adult Census Income Dataset. The model is built using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in TensorFlow/Keras.
Project Overview
Loaded and explored the Adult Income Dataset using Pandas
Performed data preprocessing:
Handling missing values
One-hot encoding categorical features
Feature scaling for numerical columns
Built and trained a Deep Neural Network (MLP)
Evaluated model performance using accuracy and other classification metrics
Generated predictions and compared actual vs predicted results
